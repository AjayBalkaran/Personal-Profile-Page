        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I’m an aspiring web designer who is looking to start a long and fruitful career. I have only ever ventured out of Canada once and out of Toronto three times, but I do consider myself an individual who loves to travel and an explorer on par with Marco Polo! I have worked at a lot of different jobs even though means venturing outside of my house. I’m excited to bring my life experience to the process of building fantastic looking websites.</p>
        <p>I’ve been a professional procrastinator and through long and grueling hours have become a master of consuming video content in all forms. I mainly specialize in the youtube variety. I believe myself to be a life-long learner even if I keep repeating the same mistakes over and over I would hope that I learn something one day, and in the end that is all that matters!</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>My most importand and valiauble skill that i can offer would have 2 b my grammer and puntuation knowledge as it is great.!. And i would love to teach all i know to the world ?</p>
        <p>I would love to master the process of building web sites and increase my knowledge, skills and abilities in:</p>
        <ul class="skills">

        <p>I’d like to work to work for a company that will pay me to get coffee for the <strong>"important"</strong> employes who are making five times my salary</p>
        <p>I would then move up the corporate ladder so that I could become a (P.L.E.A.S.E.) man like Barney Stinson and make as much money as Chandler Bing</p>
